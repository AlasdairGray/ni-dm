## NIDASH Data Model

The NIDASH Data Model (NI-DM) is a collection of specification documents and examples developed
by the [INCF](http://www.incf.org) **N**euro **I**maging **DA**ta **SH**aring Task Force that 
describe an extension the the W3C PROV standard for the domain of human brain mapping.

The goals of this repo are to foster collaboration among the standards developers working on 
the NI-DM model, and to provide a common location where users of NI-DM can find related 
information and resources.
