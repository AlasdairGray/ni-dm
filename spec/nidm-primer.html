            This document provides an intuitive introduction and guide to the NIDASH Data Model for neuroimaging data
            sharing. NIDASH defines a core vocabulary that extends the PROV Data Model for provenance with terms that
            capture information about neuroimaging research, from data acquisition to analysis and results. This primer
            explains the fundamental NIDASH concepts and provides examples of its use. The primer is intended as a
            starting point for neuroimaging scientists or developers interested in using or creating apps with NI-DM.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This primer document provides an accessible introduction to the NIDASH Data Model (NI-DM) for neuroimaging data
            sharing at Web scale. NI-DM is an extensible framework for community driven development of metadata standards
            that captures a broad spectrum of research information, particularly data provenance. The provenance of a
            given piece of neuroimaging data represents its origin, which can facilitate reproducible research by capturing
            a description of how data was processed. The NIDASH Family of Documents includes specifications that define
            recommendations for how to model neuroimaging research information across several stages of the research
            process, referred to as NI-DM Components.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a specification for neuroimaging data exchange, NI-DM Components address specific information needs for the
            neuroimaging community. Different NI-DM users or developers may have different perspectives on the types of
            neuroimaging data they would like to exchange.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                One perspective may focus on representing high-level information about a neuroimaging database. For example,
                an XNAT database provider may want to provide an standard description of the projects it contains that is
                interoperable with a similar description of a COINS or HID database. This dataset descriptor would allow a
                service to aggregate dataset descriptions that could then be interrogated at a finer level of detail.
            </li>
            <li>
                A second focus may be to query for low-level details about participant demographics and DICOM metadata (e.g.,
                TR or slice thickness) stored in an XNAT database. For example, a user may identify a dataset of interest in
                the previous example and want to retrieve the download links for structural scans from normal controls over
                18 years of age.
            </li>
            <li>
                A third perspective might be interested in the results of a statistical analysis. For example, an author
                may have published their dataset with OpenfMRI and included their results from a task-based fMRI experiment.
                A researcher may be interested in including this dataset in a meta-analysis, and can query its NI-DM
                representation to retrieve all the necessary pieces of information.

        <h4>Document Roadmap</h4>
        <p>
            NIDASH (currently) consists of 5 documents (including this one). In order to use NI-DM you do not need to
            be familiar with every specification, but there are a few that will help you get started quickly depending
            on your usage. To help navigate NIDASH, each document is broadly classified as being intended for a specific
            audience.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Users - this audience want to understand the general organization of NIDASH and use apps</li>
            <li>Developers - this audience will use the specifications to build NI-DM apps</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In the table below and Figure 1, we denote the type of each document as a Note or Component of NIDASH.
